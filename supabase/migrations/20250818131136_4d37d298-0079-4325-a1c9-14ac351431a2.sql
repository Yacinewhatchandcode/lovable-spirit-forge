O messenger of the Solomon of love! Seek thou no shelter except in the Sheba of the well-beloved, and O immortal phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of faithfulness. Therein is thy habitation, if on the wings of thy soul thou soarest to the realm of the infinite and seekest to attain thy goal.', 'Introduction'),
(2, 'persian', 'O SON OF SPIRIT!', 'The bird seeketh its nest; the nightingale the charm of the rose; whilst those birds, the hearts of men, content with transient dust, have strayed far from their eternal nest, and with eyes turned towards the slough of heedlessness are bereft of the glory of the divine presence. Alas! How strange and pitiful; for a mere cupful, they have turned away from the billowing seas of the Most High, and remained far from the most effulgent horizon.', 'Divine Guidance'),
(3, 'persian', 'O FRIEND!', 'In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with the ungodly.', 'Divine Guidance'),
(4, 'persian', 'O SON OF JUSTICE!', 'Whither can a lover go but to the land of his beloved? and what seeker findeth rest away from his heart''s desire? To the true lover reunion is life, and separation is death. His breast is void of patience and his heart hath no peace. A myriad lives he would forsake to hasten to the abode of his beloved.', 'Divine Guidance'),
(5, 'persian', 'O SON OF DUST!', 'Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent is he that disputeth idly and seeketh to advance himself over his brother. Say: O brethren! Let deeds, not words, be your adorning.', 'Divine Guidance'),

(10, 'persian', 'O SON OF DESIRE!', 'Give ear unto this: Never shall mortal eye recognize the everlasting Beauty, nor the lifeless heart delight in aught but in the withered bloom. For like seeketh like, and taketh pleasure in the company of its kind.', 'Divine Guidance'),
(11, 'persian', 'O SON OF DUST!', 'Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My beauty; stop thine ears, that thou mayest hearken unto the sweet melody of My voice; empty thyself of all learning, that thou mayest partake of My knowledge; and sanctify thyself from riches, that thou mayest obtain a lasting share from the ocean of My eternal wealth. Blind thine eyes, that is, to all save My beauty; stop thine ears to all save My word; empty thyself of all learning save the knowledge of Me; that with a clear vision, a pure heart and an attentive ear thou mayest enter the court of My holiness.', 'Divine Perception'),

(17, 'persian', 'O COMRADES!', 'The gates that open on the Placeless stand wide and the habitation of the loved one is adorned with the lovers'' blood, yet all but a few remain bereft of this celestial city, and even of these few, none but the smallest handful hath been found with a pure heart and sanctified spirit.', 'Divine Perception'),
(18, 'persian', 'O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE!', 'Proclaim unto the children of assurance that within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial paradise, a new garden hath appeared, round which circle the denizens of the realm on high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted paradise.

Solaced are the eyes of them that enter and abide therein!', 'Divine Perception'),
(19, 'persian', 'O MY FRIENDS!', 'Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence beneath the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the all-glorious paradise? Awestruck ye listened as I gave utterance to these three most holy words: O friends! Prefer not your will to Mine, never desire that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with lifeless hearts, defiled with worldly desires and cravings.

(20, 'persian', 'O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS!', 'Ages have passed and your precious lives are well-nigh ended, yet not a single breath of purity hath reached Our court of holiness from you. Though immersed in the ocean of misbelief, yet with your lips ye profess the one true faith of God. Him whom I abhor ye have loved, and of My foe ye have made a friend. Notwithstanding, ye walk on My earth complacent and self-satisfied, heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything within it shunneth you. Were ye but to open your eyes, ye would, in truth, prefer a myriad griefs unto this joy, and would count death itself better than this life.', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),
(21, 'persian', 'O MOVING FORM OF DUST!', 'I desire communion with thee, but thou wouldst put no trust in Me. The sword of thy rebellion hath felled the tree of thy hope.

While there is yet time, return, and lose not thy chance.', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),
(22, 'persian', 'O SON OF DESIRE!', 'The learned and the wise have for long years striven and failed to attain the presence of the All-Glorious; they have spent their lives in search of Him, yet did not behold the beauty of His countenance.

Yet that have eyes, behold and wonder.', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),
(23, 'persian', 'O DWELLERS IN THE CITY OF LOVE!', 'Mortal blasts have beset the everlasting candle, and the beauty of the celestial Youth is veiled in the darkness of dust. The chief of the monarchs of love is wronged by the people of tyranny and the dove of holiness lieth prisoned in the talons of owls.

How vain are your imaginings!', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),
(24, 'persian', 'O YE THAT ARE FOOLISH, YET HAVE A NAME TO BE WISE!', 'Wherefore do ye wear the guise of shepherds, when inwardly ye have become wolves, intent upon My flock?

(25, 'persian', 'O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL!', 'Ye are like clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the Divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sunbeam falleth alike upon the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference!', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),

(28, 'persian', 'O ESSENCE OF DESIRE!', 'At many a dawn have I turned from the realms of the Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on the bed of ease busied with others than Myself. Thereupon, even as the flash of the spirit, I returned to the realms of celestial glory and breathed it not in My retreats above unto the hosts of holiness.', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),
(29, 'persian', 'O SON OF BOUNTY!', 'Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay of My command I made thee to appear, and have ordained for thy training every atom in existence and the essence of all created things. Thus, ere thou didst issue from thy mother''s womb, I destined for thee two founts of gleaming milk, eyes to watch over thee, and hearts to love thee. Out of My loving-kindness, ''neath the shade of My mercy I nurtured thee, and guarded thee by the essence of My grace and favor. And My purpose in all this was that thou mightest attain My everlasting dominion and become worthy of My invisible bestowals. And yet heedless thou didst remain, and when fully grown, thou didst neglect all My bounties and occupied thyself with thine idle imaginings, in such wise that thou didst become wholly forgetful, and, turning away from the portals of the Friend didst abide within the courts of My enemy.', 'Divine Unity and Oneness'),
(30, 'persian', 'O BONDSLAVE OF THE WORLD!', 'Many a dawn hath the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of heedlessness fast asleep. Bewailing then thy plight it returned whence it came.', 'Divine Unity and Oneness');
