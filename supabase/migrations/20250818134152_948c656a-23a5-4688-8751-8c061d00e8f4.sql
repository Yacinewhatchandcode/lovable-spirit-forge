(31, 'persian', 'O SON OF EARTH!', 'Wouldst thou have Me, seek none other than Me; and wouldst thou gaze upon My beauty, close thine eyes to the world and all that is therein; for My will and the will of another than Me, even as fire and water, cannot dwell together in one heart.', 'Divine Justice and Wisdom'),
(32, 'persian', 'O BEFRIENDED STRANGER!', 'The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of My power, quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion.

(33, 'persian', 'O MY BROTHER!', 'Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed tongue, and quaff the stream of mystic holiness from My sugar-shedding lips.

Ponder this, ye that have insight!', 'Divine Love and Unity'),
(44, 'persian', 'O COMPANION OF MY THRONE!', 'Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not thyself, neither sigh and weep.

Ye bow the knee before your vain imagining, and call it truth. Ye turn your eyes towards the thorn, and name it a flower.

(46, 'persian', 'O BRETHREN IN THE PATH!', 'Wherefore have ye neglected the mention of the Loved One, and kept remote from His holy presence?

(49, 'persian', 'O CHILDREN OF DUST!', 'Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor, lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, and deprive them of the Tree of Wealth.

(52, 'persian', 'O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE AND PASSION!', 'Ye have suffered My enemy to enter My house and have cast out My friend, for ye have enshrined the love of another than Me in your hearts.

Worldly friends, seeking their own good, appear to love one the other, whereas the true Friend hath loved and doth love you for your own sakes; indeed He hath suffered for your guidance countless afflictions. Be not disloyal to such a Friend, nay rather hasten unto Him. Such is the daystar of the word of truth and faithfulness, that hath dawned above the horizon of the pen of the Lord of all names.

Well is it then with him, who, being rich, is not hindered by his riches from the eternal kingdom, nor deprived by them of imperishable dominion. By the Most Great Name! The splendor of such a wealthy man shall illuminate the dwellers of heaven even as the sun enlightens the people of the earth!', 'Divine Guidance and Wisdom'),

(56, 'persian', 'O MY SON!', 'The company of the ungodly increaseth sorrow, whilst fellowship with the righteous cleanseth the rust from off the heart.

(75, 'persian', 'O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE!', 'Set not your affections on mortal sovereignty and rejoice not therein. Ye are even as the unwary bird that with full confidence warbleth upon the bough; till of a sudden the fowler Death throweth it upon the dust, and the melody, the form and the color are gone, leaving not a trace. Wherefore take heed, O bondslaves of desire!', 'Divine Covenant and Promise'),
(76, 'persian', 'O SON OF MY HANDMAID!', 'Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it is given by deeds. Everyone must show forth deeds that are pure and holy, for words are the property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these belong only to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to distinguish yourselves by your deeds. In this wise We counsel you in this holy and resplendent tablet.', 'Divine Covenant and Promise'),
(77, 'persian', 'O SON OF JUSTICE!', 'In the night-season the beauty of the immortal Being hath repaired from the emerald height of fidelity unto the Sadratu''l-Muntahá, and wept with such a weeping that the concourse on high and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at His lamenting. Whereupon there was asked, Why the wailing and weeping? He made reply: As bidden I waited expectant upon the hill of faithfulness, yet inhaled not from them that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity. Then summoned to return I beheld, and lo! certain doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws of the dogs of earth. Thereupon the Maid of heaven hastened forth unveiled and resplendent from Her mystic mansion, and asked of their names, and all were told but one. And when urged, the first letter thereof was uttered, whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth out of their habitation of glory.

(80, 'persian', 'O MY SERVANTS!', 'Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth goodly and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves and others may profit therefrom. Thus it is incumbent on every one to engage in crafts and professions, for therein lieth the secret of wealth, O men of understanding! For results depend upon means, and the grace of God shall be all-sufficient unto you. Trees that yield no fruit have been and will ever be for the fire.', 'Divine Covenant and Promise'),
